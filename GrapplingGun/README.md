# VR Scrpits
 VR Scripts for the public use

This is just a modified Grappling gun code adapted to VR.

-> Grapplerer ( object you want to be able to grap things, using character controller but can be adapted to a RigidBody or even a Transform )

-> Grappling gun ( a script modified to be working on a VR game with hands-setup project)
